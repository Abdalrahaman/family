# Family

A new Flutter application project that provides features to the local family network ( without internet ).

## Project Features

To get to the IP addresses available on the local network, I used [Socket](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.16.2/dart-io/Socket-class.html) that it is a TCP connection between two sockets.

* Followed the sketch design to build the mobile app.
* Used **Socket** to access the IP addresses available on the local network which is a TCP connection between two sockets.
* Built Push notification when approaching the family home.
* Ring someone inside the family home to ask for entry.
* Built live chat channel using **peer-to-peer** network that contains messages.
* Used technologies **Dart, Flutter, SQLite database, Socket**
